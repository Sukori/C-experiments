# C-experiments
Little pieces of C code for fun

Only practicing since I have so little opportunity to use C in a work environment.

## Project Euler
In this folder, I only focus on solving the cases for projecteuler.net. I would make interactives versions solving for users input in another folder since not all Project euler problems are relevant with user input.
